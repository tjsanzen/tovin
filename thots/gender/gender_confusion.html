Some may call it the signs of the end times, others may call it mental illness,
confusion, and others may call it an enlightening. Of course, I am referring to
the entire topic surrounding gender identity, biological sex, and the gender
spectrum. So what caused all of this (note that we are not referring to
homosexuality, but simply gender identity/fluidity)?&nbsp;</span></b></p>

&nbsp;Believe it or not, more of it may be due to a combination of simple
labels and people not being very kind at times. I'll start out with a story; I
have a&nbsp;<a
href="https://thehappygivers.com/collections/love-thy-neighbor-collection/products/love-thy-unisex-heavy-blend-crewneck-sweatshirt-light-colors"><span
style='color:#2196F3'>pastel pink shirt</span></a>&nbsp;which I&nbsp;absolutely
love and wear all the time. I wore this particular shirt to my nephew's
birthday party one day, and it didn't take for my my brother and sister-in-law
(both Millennials) told me I looked gay wearing a pink shirt. Wait what? So my sexual
orientation can be defined simply by what color of shirt I'm wearing? Obviously
I know that my sexual orientation is not defined by what&nbsp;color shirt I
decide to wear in the morning, but is it easier to argue with every single
person about this, or easier to accept that I'm gay? Or what about for someone
who perhaps has not done as much research as myself, and so believes that
because he loves the color pink, he must really be a female inside; after all,
that's what everyone else says.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:#757575'><br>
</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:#757575'><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;This is, in my opinion, an&nbsp;example of how toxic Gender Roles
and&nbsp;Gender&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:#757575;background:white'>Stereotypes have led to gender confusion. For
years, society has told people &quot;if you are a male, you must do this; if
you are a female, you must do this.&quot; and this has had some hugely harmful
impacts on our society. Take for example the situation with the color of my
shirt; in the early 1900s, pastel colors in general were defined as infant
colors, including but not limited to blue and pink. However, as time moved on,
it was generally accepted that pink was a strong masculine color and blue was a
more fragile feminine color. It wasn't until after the Second World war that it
really started to be pushed that blue was masculine and pink was feminine, and
didn't even really stick until the late 1980s as the result of a smart
marketing ploy, playing on the human want to be accepted with their gender
identity.</span><span style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:#757575'><br>
<br>
<span style='background:white'>&nbsp; &nbsp;So what if all gender confusion is
simply due to a genius marketing strategy to convince people to buy clothing
that was not interchangeable between the genders? Then, the advertisers and
society began to press the idea so hard that to deviate from this generally
accepted fact would make you an outsider, and suddenly you would have to change
your gender identity to match the clothes you wanted to wear. Of course, this
isn't specifically for the color of ones clothes; there are many areas in which
we can see this. Why are &quot;feminine products&quot; such as lipstick and
makeup so heavily marketed to women over men? Because they like it more? Or is
it simply easier to continue to milk out the old social norms and continue to
market off and build on them than try to redefine them, even if there is
potential for more profit through redefinition?</span><br>
<br>
<span style='background:white'>&nbsp; &nbsp;However, of course there are going
to be people all over the gender spectrum, which perhaps would be better
defined as a &quot;personality spectrum;&quot; that is, how effective the
marketing has been on your personality; in my case, it hasn't been, as I still
wear a lot of pink and enjoy more &quot;feminine&quot; activities such as
painting my nails, spa days, and doing my hair. It is because of this that we
have what I believe is gender confusion; people say that one can't be a male
and wear lipstick, or can't be a female and enjoy farming, and because of this,
the people who are discriminated against are led to believe that they were
given the incorrect biological sex, and so change to a different position on
the gender spectrum, no longer identifying as they once did.</span><br>
<br>
<span style='background:white'>&nbsp; &nbsp;Who is really to blame for this? In
some way or another, almost everyone is for giving into the system at one point
or another, but particularly conservatives seem to be; should this
(conservatives) part of society suddenly start accepting men who paint their
finger nails and women who enjoy farming, would we suddenly see our
&quot;gender spectrum&quot; shrink drastically, as people would no longer feel
that they are being separated from doing what they love by their gender? It is
a fascinating theory.</span></span></p>
