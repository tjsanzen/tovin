<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            We
all know the story of Frankenstein; a mad scientist named Dr. Frankenstein
decides to rob graves and assemble body parts to make his own human. However,
while the experiment succeeds, there are some side effects, and his monster
runs away to Antarctica where it gets depressed because no one will ever love
it and commits suicide. An absolutely wonderful story, isn’t it? However, when
21-year-old Mary Shelley published the story in 1818, it had a lot more
grounding in fact that most people realize. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The
story of Frankenstein really started with surgeon Luigi Galvani. Galvani was
just having an average day at the office on January 26, 1781. While some
accounts say that Galvani was in his lab on a stormy day during an electric
storm, more accounts detail him dissecting a frog while a collogue nearby was
using what we would call an electrostatic generator. While it is debated
whether it was actually Galvani or someone else who touched the frog for the
first time, when touched with the brass scalpel, the frog’s leg convulsed. It
had been known for quite some time at this point that other animals could
produce their own electricity, such as the torpedo fish, as described by
Aristotle. However, frogs were not known to have any electrical properties, and
so Galvani was perplexed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            After
more experiments, Galvani eventually came up with the conclusion that
“Electricity was… the great vital force, by which the decrees of the
understanding, and the dictates of the will, were conveyed from the organs of
the brain to the obedient members of the body.” Then, six years later, Galvani
found his nephew hanging frogs onto metal hooks on the balcony outside his lab,
and noticed that when the hooks touched the rail, the frogs convulse
continuously. Galvani eventually concluded that he had discovered a sort of
“animal electricity” and that with the metal, he was simply connecting two
separate tanks of fluid electricity inside of the animal. He named his findings
<i>Galvanism</i>, after himself.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            However,
not everyone agreed. Alessandro Volta, a professor of physics at the University
of Pavia claimed that the electricity did not come from the frog, but rather
was being conducted through the metal touching the animal and set out to prove
it. He ended up creating a sort of battery, and then proved himself correct,
with his findings spreading across Europe in the early 1800s. However, by this
time, Luigi Galvani had already died. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            If
we jump forward a few years to 1803, we find ourselves with a man named George
Foster. Foster had been having troubles with his wife, and so she and their
daughter had moved back in with Foster’s mother-in-law. However, he was
slightly annoyed at this, and so murdered his wife and daughter, and then threw
them into the Paddington Canal on an early Sunday morning (probably- it may
have been late Saturday night). Foster was tried and found guilty and was then
sentenced to death by hanging. However, this was not considered the worst part
of his sentencing by any means. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            This
is where Galvani comes back into things. Remember his nephew? His name was
Giovanni Aldini, and like his uncle, was very interested in the animal/electric
connection. However, he had been experimenting on humans for some time, doing
various “party tricks” such as making decapitated criminals sit upright and jolting
corpses with electricity; enough so that he had gained a reputation, and Foster
had attempted to stab himself to death before his hanging, as the experiments
were considered a much worse fate than hanging, should one actually fully
succeed in bringing a human completely back to life. Upon Foster’s execution,
his body was promptly delivered to Aldini, who inserted metal rods into the
mouth and ear of the corpse. A book about Newgate prison, titled <i>The Newgate
Calendar</i> detailed what happened next; “on the first application of the
process to the face, the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the
adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and one eye actually opened. In the
subsequent part of the process, the right hand was raised and clenched, and the
legs and thighs were set in motion.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            While
it may have appeared to nearby watchers that Aldini was succeeding in bringing
the corpse back to life, his experiments ultimately failed. However, Shelley
heard about the experiments, and from this we have the masterpiece, which is <i>Frankenstein</i>,
which rather than being a science-fiction novel, is much more a glimpse into
what they thought might be the near future, should someone successfully
complete the experiment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            However,
as the experiments grew to be considered more inhumane, they became less and
less common, and are no longer practiced publicly, with most of the cases being
medical emergencies, where people were being shocked back to life after going
into cardiac arrest or having some sort of other medical issue, rather than as
an experiment. The USSR did allow some experiments, led by Dr. S.S.
Bryukhonenko at the Institute of Experimental Physiology and Therapy, where
they brought recently deceased dogs back to life. However, because the dogs had
only been deceased for a time of around 10 minutes, it was not considered truly
bringing them back to life, and they were able to successfully go on to live
normal dog lives and have cute puppies. </span></p>
