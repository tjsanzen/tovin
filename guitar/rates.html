                    <p>Firstly, I just would like to express how grateful I am for you showing interest in having yourself or someone else take guitar lessons from me! As I stated on a previous page, I try to make it as affordable as possible, but am limited by the cost of needing to afford food.</p>
                    <p>My pricing system starts at $30 for a half hour lesson, but then gets cheaper with the more lessons you commit to (for example, if you decide you want 4 lessons a month, I bundle them together for only $100)! As well as charging for my lessons, I also charge $2 per mile I have to travel to the location of the lessons. I do offer lessons from my home, but scheduling becomes slightly more difficult as I have to work around the schedules of those I live with.</p>
                    <p>How my lessons are set up varries on pre-existing skill level, but we will cover a broad range of topics, such as chords, strumming, finger-picking, Nashville Number System, leading groups or bands, live preformance, and recording. The student will have to demonstrate proficiency in each of these before moving on to the next level.
                    </p>
                    <p>Suggested materials that you must have before starting are an iPad or Tablet (a smartphone will work as well- this is simply to view your music on, as I try to avoid printing out music and wasting so much paper), and some sort of way to record yourself to track your progress (again, not required but is fun to look back on). <br>Some required materials that you must have before starting is a guitar (feel free to contact me for help finding one) and a willingness to learn!</p>
                    <p>If you're ready to get started, feel free to get in touch with me through any of my social media links below, or by contacting me through any of the following:<br>Email: <a href="mailto:hello@tjsanzen.net">hell@tjsanzen.net</a><br>Call or Text: <a href="tel:2188415586">218-841-5586</a></p>
